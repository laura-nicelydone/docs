<h3> Configuration </h3>
<p> Nicelydone's configuration settings affect how the users of your application can sign up and sign in and which properties are editable via their user profile. You can also manage user sessions, control who gets access to your application, and customize the email & SMS messages that are sent by Nicelydone during authentication flows. All of these settings can be found under the User & Authentication section in the Nicelydone Dashboard. </p>
